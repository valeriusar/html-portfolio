<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a normal person with a strong desire in learning to code.</p>

<p>I just married last year with the most beautiful female on this planet and I must admit that I love her so much that I would never thought that I could ever love some sort of a human being that much.</p>

<p>I wish I can be a good developer so that my dream cam come true. And that is that I want to be able to work from anywhere on this planet, to combine work with life, being able to travel a lot and to finantialy support my lovely wife and future kids so that we are in a constant vacation.</p>
